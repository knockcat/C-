/*How to resolve above issue? [Hint: by using, getline(cin, line);]*/


The C++ getline() is a standard library function that is used to read a string or a line from an input stream. It is a part of the <string> header. The getline() function extracts characters from the input stream and appends it to the string object until the delimiting character is encountered.
