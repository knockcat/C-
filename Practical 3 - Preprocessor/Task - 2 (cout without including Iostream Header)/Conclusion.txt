How the preprocessor will react when you use cout but don't include #include<iostream> in your code?

The program will able to pass the preprocessing step , but it will not be able to pass the assembly step as the compiler will throw an error that 

'cout' was not declared in the scope.

Hence the program will fail to perfoem further steps.........
