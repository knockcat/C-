The program will throw an error because p is a pointer type variavle which is capable of holding the address of another variable, put here p is itself intialize to array, 

therefor we shold initialize an array (arr) and then give the reference of arr ( *p = &arr) to pointer variable (*p)  then p will give the base address of the array and *p give the value at first index that is value at base address.
